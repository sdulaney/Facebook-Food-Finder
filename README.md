# Facebook Food Finder
> Find Facebook events with free food.

A sample web app that looks at the Facebook events you are attending and returns the ones with free food. Uses the [Facebook SDK for PHP](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/php/gettingstarted) for authentication and the [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) to retrieve event data.
