A sample web app that looks at the Facebook events you are attending and returns the ones with free food.

Uses the [Facebook SDK for PHP](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/php/gettingstarted) for authentication and the [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) to retrieve event data.

This project was completed at [ACM Hack Nights](http://hackucla.com/hack-nights/) at UCLA using code provided by [Akhil Nadendla] (https://github.com/AkhilNadendla).
